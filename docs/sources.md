# Sources

> A source is a place which provides the data use to generate the events which are then sent to a destination. We can transform the data from any number of __supported__ sources however we see fit.

The details of the data source are in the `source` parameter of the YML configuration file

See the examples below for more information.

 ## DynamoDb

> Data can be read from a DynamoDb.

_Example for DynamoDb:_

```yml
source:
  type: dynamo
  table: table-name
```

 ## JSON

> Data can be sourced from a JSON file

_Example for JSON:_

```yml
source:
  type: json
  file: ./examples/events/pets.seed.json
```

 ## CSV

> Data can be sourced from a CSV file.

_Example for CSV:_
```yml
source:
  type: csv
  file: ./examples/events/pets.seed.csv
```

 ## OpenSearch

> Data can be read via an OpenSearch Query.

_Example for OpenSearch:_

```yml
source:
    type: opensearch
    table: attestation
    path: _source
    get:
        query:
        match_all: {}
    size: 1000
```

## MSSQL

> MSSQL can be used as a source of data by providing a connection string and an SQL SELECT statement describing the event.

_Example for MSSQL:_

```yml
source:
    type: mssql
    connectionString: >
        Data Source=${SQL_SERV};
        Initial Catalog=TEST_ATTESTATIONS;
        User ID=${SQL_USER};
        Password=${SQL_PASS};
        Connection Timeout=1000;
        TrustServerCertificate=true;
    sql: >
        SELECT
            'organisation' AS noun,
            'create' AS verb,
            [id],
            [name]
        FROM [TEST_ATTESTATIONS].[dbo].[tbl_organisation]
    recordSetIndex: 0
```

The parser will attempt to resolve environment variable in the connection string.

The `recordSetIndex` parameter determines which record-set generated by the SQL to read events from. If the value is not supplied the default is 0.
